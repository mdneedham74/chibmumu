\section{Data tuning}
\label{sec:data}
%
The emulator has been tuned to reproduce the full simulation. For the
$\chicone \rightarrow \jpsi \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay mode it is known that 
data and simulation agree within better than $10 \%$ \cite{Anderlini:2270922}. 

 It is also known that the momentum resolution
in data is worse than simulation. This mainly effects the mass resolution for
modes with high energy release and is not very relevant for modes such
as $\chicone \rightarrow \jpsi \mu^+ \mu^-$. However, for completeness the
possibility to apply additional momentum smearing, derived from
comparisions between data and simulation using Run 2 data for the $B^+
\rightarrow J/\psi K^+$ data has been added to the emulator. Applying
it to the $\chicone \rightarrow \jpsi \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay mode it does not change
the mass resolution given by the emulator significantly.
